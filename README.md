# Transcribee

End-to-end automated workflow from voice recording to markdown note.    

Workflow as simple as one tap recording from phone or watch and transcript is added to a text file when I get back at my desk.   

Using both JustPressRecord (legacy) and Apple's native Voice Memos (default recording method now).
